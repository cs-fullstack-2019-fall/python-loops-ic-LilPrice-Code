# print("Loop")

# Exercise 1:
# Create a program that takes user input. Print Loop. Nothing is done with the user input yet.
#

# while 0 == 0:
#     user = input("Enter a word ")
#     if user == "yet":
#         break

# Exercise 2:
#
# Create a program that takes user input and prints the user input.
#
# name = input("Enter Something ")
# print(name)

# Exercise 3:
#
# Create a program that takes user input in a while loop.
# If they enter â€˜qâ€™ or 0 (your choice), quit.
# Inside the loop print LOOP

# while 0 == 0:
#     user = input("Enter a word ")
#     if user == "q" or user == 'x':
#         break
#     else:
#         print("Loop")

#
# Exercise 4:
#
# Create a program that uses a Python range to loop from 50 to 10 and print each number in the console.
#
x = range(50, 9,-1)
for n in x:
    print(n)

#
# Exercise 5:
#
# Create a program that will count down from 10 to 1 (print the number) then print LIFTOFF! in the console
#

# num = 10
# while num > 0:
#     print (num)
#     num = num -1
#
# print("LIFTOFF!!")

# Exercise 6:
#
# Create a program that prompts for the starting and ending number for a counting loop.
# In the loop, count from the start number to end number entered by 5s.
# Print each number in the console.

# num1 = int(input("Enter starting number "))
# num2 = int(input("Enter ending number "))
#
# while 0==0:
#     if num1 > num2:
#         print(num1)
#         num1 = num1 - 1
#     elif num1 < num2:
#         print(num1)
#         num1 = num1 + 1
#     elif num1 == num2:
#         print(num1)
#         break
#     else:
#         print("INVALID ANSWER")
#         break
